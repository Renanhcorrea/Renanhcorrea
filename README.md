I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills, contributing to projects that create a positive impact. Besides coding, I enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating with other developers, whether in open-source projects or private initiatives.  

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about development, or gaming. :)
